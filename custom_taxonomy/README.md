# Custom Kaiju database

## Gene prediction
The proteins sequences of 1,952 unclassified metagenomic species and 553 gut species from the human-specific reference database were predicted with [Prodigal](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal) using the default single mode. <br>
The predicted protein sequences used to create the custom database of Kaiju are available [here](https://mail2sysueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/liangqx7_mail2_sysu_edu_cn/Ef9Rv5D4VtRImiAOkJF4lc8BE9OaI-sdK6zvMudqavd-Fg?e=DsovBj).

## Custom taxonomy files
`pseudo_taxon_id.txt` contains the pseudo taxonomic identifiers assigned to each species. <br>
These records were incorporated into custom [names.dmp](https://mail2sysueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/liangqx7_mail2_sysu_edu_cn/EULDFi2Jle9Jl_H6z0Ptg1UBwnl2J9kCGPRPYbBL4oWxPw?e=SRM5xx) and [nodes.dmp](https://mail2sysueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/liangqx7_mail2_sysu_edu_cn/Ef0eh428Ce1PsLDpWScuid0BqehVzWAFWyaEb2mSDdmLNw?e=d7WzMn).

## Kaiju index 
Kaiju index for the custom database was built following the manual available [here](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/kaiju). <br>
The resulted `fmi` index is available [here](https://mail2sysueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/liangqx7_mail2_sysu_edu_cn/EWRWpxMtNXFDotuBjY350WIB0PExJv40jlqzDPmX8c0mYA?e=CyNyug).
