# DeepMicrobes-data
Supporting data for the DeepMicrobes paper (under preparation). <br>
The codes of DeepMicrobes are available at https://github.com/MicrobeLab/DeepMicrobes


## Sequences of benchmark datasets
* Reads simulated from 3,269 gut-derived MAGs
* Mock communities generated from gastrointestinal bacterial isolates
* Reads simulated from species absent from reference databases

## Abundance profiles of different taxonomic classifiers on the mock communities
* Genus-level results
* Species-level results

## Results of the IBD gut metagenome dataset
* Species profiles generated with DeepMicrobes
* Example fastq files from the dataset

## Supplementary tables (.csv)

* `Table S1` Metadata of the 2,505 genomes used as reference to train the species classification model		
* `Table S2` Metadata of the 3,269 high quality MAGs used to benchmark the read-level specificity and sensitivity of different species classification models	
* `Table S3` Number of reads sampled from each whole-genome-sequenced bacterial isolates collected from human fecal samples
* `Table S4` True genus profiles of the ten mock communities
* `Table S5` True relative abundance of  14 species members of the ten mock communities shared by the database of nine species classification tools
* `Table S6` False positive species classification of different tools on data sets generated by simulating 1x coverage reads using 121 genomes from species not included in RefSeq database or training (query aligned = 10-60%, ANI < 95%)
* `Table S7` The effect of <i>k</i>-mer length on vocabulary size
* `Table S8` The search space of hyperparameters and the hyperparameters chosen for each model (see https://github.com/MicrobeLab/DeepMicrobes for details of how the hyperparameters are adopted for each model and each layer)
* `Table S9` Read-level specificity of different model architectures on variable-length reads simulated from 3,269 MAGs excluded from training
* `Table S10` Read-level sensitivity of different model architectures on variable-length reads simulated from 3,269 MAGs excluded from training
* `Table S11` Read-level specificity of the best model (Embed + LSTM + Attention) on fixed-length reads simulated based on error profiles of different sequencing platforms using 3,269 MAGs excluded from training	
* `Table S12` Read-level sensitivity of the best model (Embed + LSTM + Attention) on fixed-length reads simulated based on error profiles of different sequencing platforms using 3,269 MAGs excluded from training
* `Table S13` Read level specificity and sensitivity of genus classification measured on the ten mock communities under different confidence scores
* `Table S14` LEfSe analysis on the species profiles of 106 subjects from iHMP
			
## Labeled genome sequences used to create the training set
* Genome collections for the species/genus model
* Training labels are provided in the sequence IDs

## Vocabulary
* The vocabulary of <i>k</i>-mers used in TFRecord conversion. The pre-trained DeepMicrobes models use 12-mers.
* Complementary <i>k</i>-mers are represented as the same embedding vector. Such representation requires `merged` <i>k</i>-mers when converting fasta/fastq sequences to TFRecord.

## Custom Kaiju database
* Pseudo taxonomy identifiers assigned to each species in the complete bacterial repertoire of the human gut microbiota
* Custom `names.dmp` and `nodes.dmp` 
* Predicted protein sequences from the genome of each species
* Kaiju index of the custom database
